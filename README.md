### What I learned

Mastering TypeScript for Better Code Quality
One of the most notable aspects of this project was deepening my understanding of TypeScript. Its strong typing system helped me write cleaner, more maintainable code, and it reduced the number of runtime errors significantly. I also learned how to define types for functions, objects, and components, which made debugging and collaboration more efficient.
